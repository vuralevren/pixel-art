# How to build Pixel App

## What is Pixel Art?
Pixel art is a form of digital art where images are created and edited at the pixel level. It typically features low resolution and a limited color palette and is often used to create retro-style graphics in video games and other digital media. The style is characterized by its blocky, pixelated appearance and is created using software tools designed explicitly for pixel art.

## What is Altogic?
Altogic backend as a service platform allows you to create and start running your backend apps in minutes. With your backend apps, you can manage your application data in a database, cache your data in memory, execute database transactions to ensure data integrity, run complex business logic through synchronous and asynchronous services, manage user sessions, schedule jobs to be executed at a specific time or interval, send and receive real-time messages through WebSockets and more.

## Creating an Altogic Application
As you are aware, Altogic will be used in this project, so if you do not already have an account, you must create one from the [Altogic Designer.](https://designer.altogic.com/)

> I advise you to review the [documentation](https://www.altogic.com/client/installation) for more in-depth details.
